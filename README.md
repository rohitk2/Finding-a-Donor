# Finding Donors for Charity

## Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a person making a donation to charity. Using census data, the project identifies high-value donors to optimize outreach efforts, ensuring the most efficient use of resources.

## Objectives

- Analyze census data to preprocess and clean it for modeling.
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict donor likelihood.
- Interpret model results to provide actionable insights for targeted outreach.

## Project Structure

- **`finding_donors.ipynb`**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`finding_donors.html`**: An HTML summary of the notebook for quick reference and sharing.
- **`census.csv`**: Dataset used for training and evaluation, containing census information.
- **`visuals.py`**: Custom visualization functions used for data analysis and presentation.
- **Other Folders**:
  - **`.ipynb_checkpoints`**: Jupyter Notebook checkpoints.
  - **`__pycache__`**: Cached Python files for faster execution.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Load and explore the `census.csv` dataset.
   - Analyze key features and their relationships to donor likelihood.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.
3. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, SVMs, Logistic Regression).
   - Optimize hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Compare the models to select the best-performing one.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Use custom visualizations from `visuals.py` to interpret results and present insights.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
- **Visualization**: Custom plots using `visuals.py` and standard Python libraries.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and modeling.

## Results

The final model achieved **XX% accuracy** (replace with your results), demonstrating its ability to accurately predict donor likelihood. Insights from this project can help charities prioritize outreach efforts, maximizing donations and resource efficiency.
